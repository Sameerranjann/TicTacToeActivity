# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Kotlin / Java / Python / Web / Console)

Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple yet classic 2-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with **X** and **O**. The first player to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a **draw**.

This project is perfect for beginners to practice game logic, conditional statements, loops, and user input handling.
